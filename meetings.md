Summary of what was discussed during the meeting:
- **API Overview**: We reviewed the API overview and discussed its description quality. The API was described clearly, but the overall description was somewhat brief.
- **Main Concepts**: The main concepts were thoroughly covered, and the concepts were made clear. However, the diagram representing these concepts could have been more detailed.
- **API Uses**: We discussed how the API is used, and the descriptions provided were clear. The distinction between the client and the service was also well explained.
- **Related Work**: The related work was explained well, with a strong description quality. However, the client example provided was minimal and could be expanded.

## Action Points:
